### Hi there! Welcome to my data analytics projects. A little bit about me...

- :earth_africa: My current goal is to grow into mentorship and subject matter expertise on a high-impact and curious data team
- 😁 I have a wide range of soft skills that inform my technical chops: project management, sales, startup generalist, small business owner
- :books: I primarily conduct analyses in SQL & Python, and I'm currently taking courses in Power BI and Tableau to hit the ground running with any new BI tool I come across
- :tada: I'd love to collaborate on climate & social justice related projects! 
- :sunrise_over_mountains: I spend my time in Muay Thai, art, reading and rock climbing
- :blush: My pronouns are she/her
